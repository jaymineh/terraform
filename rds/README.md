# Creating AWS RDS in Terraform

In this trial, I created an RDS instance from the terminal using Terraform. Details are in the `main.tf` file.

*Note that in newer terraform versions, the name of the database is set as `db_name`, as opposed to the regular `name` that has been used in older versions.
