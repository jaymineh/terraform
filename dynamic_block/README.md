# Dynamic Blocks on security groups

This is a continuation from the security groups hands-on. Imagine you have to configure security groups manually for a large number of instances. It would quickly turn into a nightmare.

Dynamic blocks are the way to solve the above situation. It is a way to dynamically set up security groups, instead of having to manually set them up individually. Dynamic blocks can be used in more than just security groups though.
